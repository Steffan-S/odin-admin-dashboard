Repository for the assigment 'Admin dashboard' for The Odin Project

- Live demo: https://steffan-s.github.io/odin-admin-dashboard/

## Assignment
Now that youâ€™ve had plenty of practice using Grid, we are going to build a full dashboard design. For this project, use whatever tools you need to get it done, but try to lean on Grid for the majority of the layout work. Go back through the lessons or practice assignments if you need a refresher.

### Original design

## Inspired by
When browsing other people submissions I came across Mmackz submission which I liked a lot more and decided to recreate his Admin Dashboard instead of The Odin Project one.
